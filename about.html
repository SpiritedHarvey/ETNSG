        This group, which is celebrating 25 years of organization, is targeted to people with neurological conditions. Neurological conditions are medical diagnoses that are given by <a class="bodya" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22277-neurologist">neurologist</a>. To lean about some examples, click on the black link in the previous sentence. Offhand, some neurological conditions are epilepsy (a seizure disoroder) and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder).
    </p>
    <p>
        We support all our members that have neurological conditions by purchasing medical equipment, advocacy, and socialization. We rely on donations and time from volunteers to assist in producing well-being in people with neurological disorders. Being a 501(c)(3) organization, all contributions are helpful and tax-exempt. Contact us if you are willing to donate, volunteer at one of our events, or otherwise provide feedback to the group. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We operate in the Deep East Texas area and regularly communicate with our members via email. As stated before, please contact us if you would like to become a members and know about our operations. Importantly, we observe Thanksgiving and Christmas annually with one another. Other traditions are found within our calendar and we invite you to celebrate with us. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are governed by board members and bylaws. They meet and discuss major and minor aspects and duties and changes to the plans of our organization. This includes logistical planning, purchasing decisions, income recognition, and more. Hopefully, this has both persuaded and informed you of our purposes; <u>tag along and bring a friend if you'd like!</u>
